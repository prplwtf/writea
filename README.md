**writea** is a blog website made with HTML and Javascript.
Because of this, writea is completely serverless!
Just throw it into your web server of choice and it should just work.

Writea has support for a bunch of nifty features which include (but is not limited to):\
• Markdown formatting in blog posts.\
• Built-in theme support.\
• Configuration is stored in YaML files.\
• Emoji convertion (\:sob: -> 😭).
